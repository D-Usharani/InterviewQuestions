            <p>Spring Boot simplifies Spring application development by providing default configurations, removing the need for manual setup, and offering auto-configuration for various components. It also includes embedded servers for easy deployment, eliminates boilerplate code, and supports the use of starters to manage dependencies and focus on application logic.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question5">
            <h2>What is the purpose of the Spring Boot Starter modules?</h2>
            <p>Spring Boot Starter modules are a set of predefined templates that bundle commonly used libraries and configurations for specific tasks, such as web development or data access. They simplify the process of adding dependencies and setting up project configurations, allowing developers to start building applications quickly without worrying about compatibility and configuration issues.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question6">
            <h2>Explain the concept of "auto-configuration" in Spring Boot.</h2>
            <p>Auto-configuration is a key feature of Spring Boot that automatically configures application components based on the classpath and the presence of certain libraries. It eliminates the need for manual configuration by providing sensible defaults and predefined configurations for various Spring components, making it easier for developers to create production-ready applications without explicit configuration.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question7">
            <h2>What is the Spring Boot Actuator and what information does it provide?</h2>
            <p>The Spring Boot Actuator is a set of production-ready features that help monitor and manage Spring Boot applications. It provides various endpoints that expose information about application health, metrics, environment properties, and more. These endpoints can be used for monitoring, troubleshooting, and managing the application during runtime.</p>
        </div>
        
        <!-- Continue with answers for the remaining questions -->
        <div class="question" id="question8">
            <h2>What is Spring Boot's default embedded server?</h2>
            <p>Spring Boot provides a choice of default embedded servers, including Apache Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow. The choice of the embedded server depends on the project's dependencies and the server's compatibility with the application.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question9">
            <h2>Explain the use of the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation.</h2>
            <p>The `@SpringBootApplication` annotation is a meta-annotation that combines three Spring annotations: `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan`. It's commonly placed on the main application class and serves as a convenient way to enable Spring Boot features, configure the application, and scan for Spring components within the specified package and its sub-packages.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question10">
            <h2>How can you define external properties in a Spring Boot application?</h2>
            <p>You can define external properties in a Spring Boot application using property files such as `application.properties` or `application.yml`. These files can be placed in the classpath or external locations. Spring Boot automatically detects and loads the properties, allowing you to customize the application's configuration without modifying the source code.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question11">
            <h2>What is the purpose of the `application.properties` (or `application.yml`) file?</h2>
            <p>The `application.properties` or `application.yml` file is used to configure Spring Boot applications. It allows you to define various properties, such as database connection settings, server port, logging configurations, and more. Spring Boot automatically loads and applies these configurations, enabling easy customization of the application's behavior without the need for extensive coding.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question12">
            <h2>Explain the difference between Spring Boot's `@RestController` and `@Controller`.</h2>
            <p>`@RestController` is a specialized version of the `@Controller` annotation that combines `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`. It's used to create RESTful web services that return data as JSON or XML. The `@Controller` annotation, on the other hand, is used to create web pages and typically returns a view name.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question13">
            <h2>What is Spring Boot DevTools and how does it improve development?</h2>

        <div class="question" id="question14">
            <h2>Explain the role of Spring Boot Starter Parent in project inheritance.</h2>
            <p>The Spring Boot Starter Parent is a special parent POM (Project Object Model) that provides common configurations and dependencies for Spring Boot projects. When a Spring Boot project uses the Starter Parent, it inherits default settings, plugins, and dependencies. This promotes consistency and reduces the need to configure common settings across multiple projects.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question15">
            <h2>What are Spring Boot Profiles and how are they useful?</h2>
            <p>Spring Boot Profiles allow you to define different sets of configurations for different environments or scenarios. By using profiles, you can customize application behavior based on factors like development, testing, and production environments. Profiles are particularly useful when you want to manage properties, database configurations, and other settings that vary across different deployment stages.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question16">
            <h2>How can you create a custom Spring Boot Starter?</h2>
            <p>To create a custom Spring Boot Starter, you need to follow these steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Create a new Maven or Gradle project for your starter.</li>
                <li>Organize your starter's structure with specific directories and classes.</li>
                <li>Define the starter's auto-configuration classes and properties.</li>
                <li>Create a `spring-boot-autoconfigure` module and package your auto-configuration classes.</li>
                <li>Create a `spring-boot-starter` module to bundle the auto-configuration and dependencies.</li>
                <li>Publish the starter to a repository or use it in other projects.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question17">
            <h2>What is Spring Boot Data JPA and how do you use it?</h2>
            <p>Spring Boot Data JPA is a sub-project of Spring Data that simplifies database access and manipulation using the Java Persistence API (JPA).

            <h2>What is the difference between a regular controller and a <code>@RestController</code> in Spring?</h2>
            <p>In Spring, both a regular controller and a <code>@RestController</code> are used to handle incoming HTTP requests and return appropriate responses. However, there is a key distinction between them based on the nature of the responses they generate.</p>
            <p>A regular controller, annotated with <code>@Controller</code>, is primarily used for building web pages or applications that generate HTML views. The methods within a regular controller often return logical view names or references to HTML templates. These methods handle user interactions and orchestrate the rendering of HTML views.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, a <code>@RestController</code> is a specialized version of a controller introduced in Spring specifically for building RESTful web services. The methods within a <code>@RestController</code> return data in a format like JSON or XML, rather than rendering views. The response data is automatically serialized to the specified format, making it well-suited for building APIs that provide data to clients.</p>
            <p>In summary, while both regular controllers and <code>@RestController</code> controllers handle HTTP requests, the choice between them depends on whether you are building web pages (using regular controllers) or exposing APIs that return data (using <code>@RestController</code>).</p>
