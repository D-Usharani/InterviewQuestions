            <h2>What is the difference between an array and a pointer in C?</h2>
            <p>In C, an array is a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations. A pointer, on the other hand, is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. While arrays have a fixed size, pointers can point to dynamically allocated memory. Arrays are not modifiable as a whole, but pointers can be re-assigned to point to different memory locations.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question" id="question2">
            <h2>Explain the concept of memory management in C.</h2>
            <p>Memory management in C involves allocating and deallocating memory for variables and data structures. Memory allocation can be done statically (at compile time) using arrays or dynamically (at runtime) using functions like "malloc" and "calloc." Proper memory deallocation is essential to prevent memory leaks, which can occur if memory is not freed after its use using the "free" function.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question" id="question3">
            <h2>What are pointers and how are they used?</h2>
            <p>Pointers in C are variables that store memory addresses. They are used to manipulate memory, pass references to functions, and manage dynamic memory allocation. Pointers can be used to access and modify the values stored at a particular memory location. They are commonly used in scenarios where direct memory access and manipulation are required.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question" id="question4">
            <h2>What is the significance of "const" keyword in C?</h2>
            <p>The "const" keyword in C is used to indicate that a variable's value cannot be modified after its initialization. It ensures that the variable remains constant throughout its lifetime. This helps in preventing unintentional modification of variables and also allows the compiler to perform optimizations. "const" can be applied to variables, function parameters, and function return types.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question" id="question5">
            <h2>Explain the difference between "malloc" and "calloc" functions.</h2>
            <p>Both "malloc" and "calloc" are memory allocation functions in C. However, they have differences in how they allocate and initialize memory:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>malloc:</strong> Allocates a specified number of bytes of memory and leaves the memory uninitialized.</li>
                <li><strong>calloc:</strong> Allocates memory for an array of elements and initializes all bytes to zero.</li>

            <h2>What is the difference between C and C++?</h2>
            <p>C and C++ are both programming languages, but C++ is an extension of C with additional features such as classes, objects, and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. C is procedural, while C++ supports both procedural and OOP paradigms. C++ includes features like classes, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which are not present in C.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question" id="question7">
            <h2>Explain the concept of classes and objects in C++.</h2>
            <p>In C++, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties (data members) and behaviors (member functions) that the objects of that class will have. Objects are instances of a class and represent real-world entities. They encapsulate data and methods, allowing for modular and organized programming. Classes provide a way to achieve abstraction and encapsulation in C++.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question" id="question8">
            <h2>What is inheritance in C++?</h2>
            <p>Inheritance is a fundamental OOP concept in C++ where a new class (derived or subclass) is created from an existing class (base or superclass). The derived class inherits the properties and behaviors of the base class. It allows for code reuse, extensibility, and the creation of a hierarchical class structure. C++ supports multiple types of inheritance, including single, multiple, and multilevel inheritance.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question" id="question9">
            <h2>What is the "virtual" keyword in C++?</h2>
            <p>The "virtual" keyword is used in C++ to declare a virtual function in a base class. A virtual function enables dynamic polymorphism, allowing a derived class to provide its own implementation of the function. When a function is declared as virtual, the correct function to be called is determined at runtime based on the object's actual type. This facilitates the implementation of overridden functions in derived classes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question" id="question10">
            <h2>Explain the concept of function overloading in C++.</h2>
            <p>Function overloading in C++ allows multiple functions with the same name but different parameter lists to exist in the same scope. The compiler selects the appropriate function to call based on the arguments provided during the function call. Function overloading enables developers to create more intuitive and expressive function names and improve code readability by providing specialized versions of a function for different data types or argument combinations.</p>

A virtual function enables dynamic polymorphism, allowing a derived class to provide its own implementation of the function. When a function is declared as virtual, the correct function to be called is determined at runtime based on the object's actual type. This facilitates the implementation of overridden functions in derived classes.</p>

            <h2>Explain the concept of function overloading in C++.</h2>
            <p>Function overloading in C++ allows multiple functions with the same name but different parameter lists to exist in the same scope. The compiler selects the appropriate function to call based on the arguments provided during the function call. Function overloading enables developers to create more intuitive and expressive function names and improve code readability by providing specialized versions of a function for different data types or argument combinations.</p>

It loads classes from various sources, such as the local file system, network, or other sources. There are different types of class loaders, including the bootstrap class loader, extension class loader, and application class loader.</p>

            <h2>Explain the difference between instance variables and class variables.</h2>
            <p>Instance variables (also called instance fields) are unique to each instance of a class. They store data that is specific to an object and can have different values for different objects. Class variables (also called static variables) are shared among all instances of a class. They store data that is common to all objects of the class and is the same across instances.</p>

        <div class="question" id="question58">
            <h2>What are local variables in Java?</h2>
            <p>Local variables are variables declared within a method, constructor, or a block of code. They have limited scope and are only accessible within the block where they are declared. Local variables must be initialized before they are used, and they are stored on the stack memory.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question" id="question59">
            <h2>Explain the concept of "this" keyword in Java.</h2>
            <p>The "this" keyword in Java refers to the current instance of a class. It is used to distinguish between instance variables and parameters with the same name, and to access instance methods and variables within the class. "this" can also be used to invoke another constructor of the same class.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question" id="question60">
            <h2>What are static blocks in Java?</h2>
            <p>Static blocks are used to initialize static variables and perform class-level initialization. They are executed when the class is loaded by the class loader, and they run before the class's constructor is called. Static blocks are often used to set up resources that are required by all instances of the class.</p>

        Multithreading:
        
        
        <div class="question" id="question61">
            <h2>What is multithreading?</h2>
            <p>Multithreading is a programming technique that allows multiple threads to execute concurrently within a single process. Threads are independent paths of execution that share the same process resources, such as memory space. Multithreading is used to achieve better CPU utilization, improved responsiveness, and efficient utilization of system resources.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question" id="question62">
            <h2>Explain the difference between process and thread.</h2>
            <p>A process is an independent unit of execution that runs in its own memory space and has its own system resources. Processes do not share memory with each other. A thread is a smaller unit of execution within a process. Threads within the same process share memory space and resources, making communication between them more efficient than between separate processes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question" id="question63">
            <h2>What is a thread in Java?</h2>
            <p>A thread in Java represents an independent path of execution within a process. Threads allow multiple tasks to be performed concurrently, and they share the same memory space. Java supports multithreading through the <code>Thread</code> class and the <code>Runnable</code> interface.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question" id="question64">
            <h2>What is the purpose of the <code>Runnable</code> interface?</h2>
            <p>The <code>Runnable</code> interface in Java is used to define the code that a thread will execute. It provides a way to separate the code to be executed by a thread from the mechanics of creating and managing threads. Threads that implement <code>Runnable</code> can be passed to a <code>Thread</code> object for execution.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question" id="question65">
            <h2>What is synchronization in Java multithreading?</h2>
            <p>Synchronization in Java multithreading refers to the coordination of multiple threads to ensure that they access shared resources in an orderly and safe manner. It prevents race conditions and data inconsistencies by allowing only one thread to execute a synchronized block or method at a time. This is achieved using the <code>synchronized</code> keyword.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question" id="question66">
            <h2>Explain the lifecycle of a thread in Java.</h2>
            <p>The lifecycle of a thread in Java consists of several stages: <code>New</code>, <code>Runnable</code>, <code>Running</code>, <code>Blocked</code>, <code>Waiting</code>, <code>Timed Waiting</code>, and <code>Terminated</code>. A thread is created in the <code>New</code> state and transitions through these stages as it is started, scheduled by the operating system, and eventually completes its execution.</p>

        <div class="question" id="question67">
            <h2>What is the difference between <code>final</code> and <code>constant</code> in Java?</h2>
            <p><code>final</code> is a keyword in Java that can be applied to variables, methods, and classes. When applied to a variable, it indicates that the variable's value cannot be changed once assigned. Constants, on the other hand, are variables that hold fixed values and are often declared using the <code>final</code> keyword along with the <code>static</code> keyword. Constants are usually used for holding values that don't change, such as mathematical constants.</p>

        <div class="question" id="question68">
            <h2>What are the different error handling techniques in Java?</h2>
            <p>Error handling in Java involves handling exceptions and other errors that can occur during program execution. Common error handling techniques include using <code>try</code>, <code>catch</code>, and <code>finally</code> blocks to handle exceptions, using custom exception classes for specific error conditions, and using logging frameworks to capture and report errors. Additionally, proper error messages and feedback can help improve the user experience.</p>
