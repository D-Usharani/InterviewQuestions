        <div class="question" id="question1">
            <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted scripting language used to create dynamic and interactive websites. It is commonly used for client-side scripting to enhance user experiences by adding interactivity, animations, and dynamic content to web pages.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question2">
            <h2>Explain the differences between JavaScript and Java.</h2>
            <p>Despite their similar names, JavaScript and Java are two distinct programming languages. Java is a general-purpose programming language used for various applications, including server-side development. JavaScript, on the other hand, is primarily used for client-side scripting within web browsers.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question3">
            <h2>What are the data types in JavaScript?</h2>
            <p>JavaScript has several data types, including primitive data types like numbers, strings, booleans, null, undefined, and symbol (added in ES6), as well as reference data types like objects and arrays.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question4">
            <h2>Explain the concept of variables in JavaScript.</h2>
            <p>Variables in JavaScript are used to store and manage data values. They provide a way to give names to values and use those names throughout the code. Variables can be declared using the "var," "let," or "const" keywords, each having different scoping and reassignment rules.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question5">
            <h2>What are the different ways to declare variables in JavaScript?</h2>
            <p>Variables in JavaScript can be declared using the "var," "let," or "const" keywords. "Var" has function scope, "let" has block scope, and "const" is used for constants whose values can't be changed after assignment.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question6">
            <h2>Explain the difference between "undefined" and "null" in JavaScript.</h2>
            <p>In JavaScript, "undefined" means a variable has been declared but hasn't been assigned a value, while "null" is an assignment value that represents the absence of any object value.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question7">
            <h2>What is a function in JavaScript and how do you define one?</h2>
            <p>A function in JavaScript is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Functions can be defined using the "function" keyword, followed by a name, parameters in parentheses, and the function body enclosed in curly braces. They can be invoked using their name followed by parentheses.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question8">
            <h2>Explain the purpose of the "return" statement in a JavaScript function.</h2>
            <p>The "return" statement is used in a JavaScript function to specify the value that the function will produce. It marks the end of the function's execution and provides the output value that can be used in the calling code.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question9">
            <h2>What is a callback function and how is it used?</h2>
            <p>A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed at a later time, often after a specific event or action. Callbacks are commonly used in asynchronous programming, such as handling responses from APIs or user interactions.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question10">
            <h2>Explain the difference between "let," "const," and "var" for variable declaration.</h2>
            <p>"let," "const," and "var" are used to declare variables in JavaScript, but they have different scoping and reassignment rules. "let" and "const" have block scope, while "var" has function scope. "const" declares a constant value that can't be reassigned, whereas "let" allows reassignment.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question11">
            <h2>What is an array in JavaScript and how do you create one?</h2>
            <p>An array in JavaScript is a data structure used to store a collection of values. It is created using square brackets and can contain elements of various data types. For example: <code>let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];</code></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question12">
            <h2>Explain the use of "push," "pop," "shift," and "unshift" methods in arrays.</h2>
            <p>The "push" method adds elements to the end of an array, "pop" removes the last element, "shift" removes the first element, and "unshift" adds elements to the beginning of an array.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question13">
            <h2>What is an object in JavaScript and how do you create one?</h2>
            <p>An object in JavaScript is a complex data type that can hold multiple key-value pairs. Objects are created using curly braces and can contain properties and methods. For example: <code>let person = { name: "John", age: 30 };</code></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question14">
            <h2>Explain the concept of "this" keyword in JavaScript.</h2>
            <p>The "this" keyword refers to the object that is currently executing the code. Its value depends on how and where the function is called. In a method, "this" refers to the object that owns the method, while in a regular function, it can refer to the global object or be undefined in strict mode.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question15">
            <h2>What are arrow functions in JavaScript?</h2>
            <p>Arrow functions are a concise way to define functions in JavaScript. They have a shorter syntax compared to regular functions and inherit the value of "this" from the enclosing context. Arrow functions are commonly used for short, anonymous functions and as callbacks.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question16">
            <h2>Explain the purpose of the "map" method in JavaScript.</h2>
            <p>The "map" method is used to create a new array by applying a function to each element of the original array. It transforms the elements and returns a new array of the same length. The original array remains unchanged.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question17">
            <h2>What is an example of a closure in JavaScript?</h2>
            <p>A closure is a function that has access to its own scope, the scope in which it is defined, and the scope of its outer function. An example of a closure is a function defined inside another function that retains access to the outer function's variables even after the outer function has finished executing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question" id="question18">
            <h2>Explain the concept of hoisting in JavaScript.</h2>
            <p>Hoisting is a behavior in JavaScript where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during compilation, before the code is executed. However, only the declarations are hoisted, not the assignments.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question19">
            <h2>What is the purpose of the "typeof" operator in JavaScript?</h2>
            <p>The "typeof" operator is used to determine the data type of a value or variable in JavaScript. It returns a string indicating whether the value is a number, string, boolean, object, function, or undefined.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question20">
            <h2>Explain the concept of event handling in JavaScript.</h2>
            <p>Event handling in JavaScript involves responding to user interactions or actions, such as clicks, key presses, and form submissions. Event listeners are attached to HTML elements, and when the specified event occurs, the associated function (event handler) is executed.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question21">
            <h2>What is the purpose of the "addEventListener" method in JavaScript?</h2>
            <p>The "addEventListener" method is used to attach an event listener to an HTML element. It allows you to specify the type of event (e.g., "click," "keydown"), and when that event occurs, the specified callback function is executed.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question22">
            <h2>Explain the difference between "null" and "undefined" in JavaScript.</h2>
            <p>"Null" represents the intentional absence of any object value, while "undefined" indicates that a variable has been declared but has not been assigned a value. It's also the default value for function parameters and uninitialized variables.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question23">
            <h2>What is the purpose of the "localStorage" and "sessionStorage" objects?</h2>
            <p>The "localStorage" and "sessionStorage" objects are used to store key-value pairs in the browser's storage. "localStorage" stores data with no expiration date, while "sessionStorage" stores data for the duration of a session (until the browser is closed).</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question24">
            <h2>Explain the concept of asynchronous programming in JavaScript.</h2>
            <p>Asynchronous programming in JavaScript involves executing code without blocking the main thread. It's essential for tasks that might take time to complete, such as network requests or file operations. Callbacks, promises, and async/await are techniques used for managing asynchronous operations.</p>

            <h2>Explain the concept of closure in JavaScript and provide an example.</h2>
            <p>A closure is a function that has access to its own scope and the scope of its outer function, even after the outer function has finished executing. This allows data encapsulation and the creation of private variables. An example is a function returning another function that remembers its parent's variables:</p>
            <pre><code>function outerFunction() {
          let outerVariable = "I am from the outer function";
          
          function innerFunction() {
            console.log(outerVariable);
          }
          
          return innerFunction;
        }
        
        let closure = outerFunction();
        closure(); // Outputs: "I am from the outer function"</code></pre>
