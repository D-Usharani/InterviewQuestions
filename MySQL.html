            <h2>What is MySQL?</h2>
            <p>MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that allows users to create, manage, and interact with databases. It uses structured query language (SQL) to manipulate and retrieve data stored in relational databases.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question2">
            <h2>Explain the concept of a relational database.</h2>
            <p>A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into tables with rows and columns. It establishes relationships between tables based on common data attributes. This structure allows for efficient data storage, retrieval, and manipulation while ensuring data integrity and minimizing data duplication.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question3">
            <h2>What are tables in MySQL?</h2>
            <p>In MySQL, tables are the fundamental units for storing data. Each table consists of rows and columns, where each row represents a record and each column represents a specific attribute of that record. Tables are used to organize and store data in a structured manner.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question4">
            <h2>What is SQL and how is it related to MySQL?</h2>
            <p>SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It provides a standardized way to interact with databases, including tasks such as creating tables, inserting data, querying data, updating records, and more. MySQL is an RDBMS that uses SQL as its primary language for interacting with databases.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question5">
            <h2>What is a primary key in MySQL?</h2>
            <p>A primary key is a unique identifier for a record within a table. It ensures that each row in the table is uniquely identifiable and prevents duplicate or null values. A primary key can consist of one or multiple columns, and its purpose is to enforce data integrity and provide a reference point for relationships with other tables.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question6">
            <h2>Explain the purpose of foreign keys in MySQL.</h2>
            <p>Foreign keys are used to establish relationships between tables in a relational database. They define a column or set of columns in one table that references the primary key in another table. Foreign keys enforce referential integrity, ensuring that data remains consistent across related tables and allowing for data retrieval and analysis using joins.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question7">
            <h2>What is normalization in the context of databases?</h2>
            <p>Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to eliminate data redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves breaking down large tables into smaller, related tables and establishing relationships through foreign keys. The goal of normalization is to minimize data duplication, anomalies, and inconsistencies while ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question8">
            <h2>Explain the difference between "CHAR" and "VARCHAR" data types.</h2>
            <p>In MySQL, both "CHAR" and "VARCHAR" are used to store character string data. However, "CHAR" has a fixed length, and any unused space is padded with spaces, while "VARCHAR" has a variable length and only uses as much space as needed. "VARCHAR" is more space-efficient for storing strings with varying lengths, while "CHAR" is useful for fixed-length strings to maintain consistent data storage.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question9">
            <h2>What is the purpose of the "SELECT" statement in SQL?</h2>
            <p>The "SELECT" statement is used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database. It allows you to specify the columns you want to retrieve, filter data using conditions in the "WHERE" clause, and perform calculations or transformations on the retrieved data. "SELECT" is a fundamental SQL operation for querying and analyzing data.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question10">
            <h2>Explain the use of the "WHERE" clause in SQL queries.</h2>
            <p>The "WHERE" clause is used in SQL queries to filter data based on specified conditions. It allows you to retrieve only the rows that satisfy the given conditions. For example, you can use the "WHERE" clause to retrieve all records where a certain column value is greater than a specific value or matches a particular pattern.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question" id="question11">
            <h2>What is the purpose of the "ORDER BY" clause in SQL?</h2>
            <p>The "ORDER BY" clause is used in SQL queries to sort the result set based on specified columns. It allows you to arrange the retrieved data in ascending or descending order. By default, the sorting is done in ascending order, but you can use the "ASC" keyword for ascending or "DESC" keyword for descending order.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question12">
            <h2>Explain the "GROUP BY" clause in SQL and its use.</h2>
            <p>The "GROUP BY" clause is used to group rows with similar values in specified columns. It is often used with aggregate functions such as "SUM," "COUNT," "AVG," etc., to perform calculations on grouped data. The "GROUP BY" clause divides the result set into groups and returns a summary for each group, allowing for data analysis and reporting.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question13">
            <h2>What is an SQL join and how does it work?</h2>
            <p>An SQL join is used to combine rows from multiple tables based on related columns. It allows you to retrieve data from multiple tables as a single result set. The join operation matches rows from different tables based on common values in specified columns. Different types of joins, such as "INNER JOIN," "LEFT JOIN," "RIGHT JOIN," and "FULL JOIN," define how the matching is performed and which rows are included in the result.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question14">
            <h2>Explain the concept of database indexing.</h2>
            <p>Database indexing is a technique used to improve the speed and efficiency of data retrieval operations in a database. An index is a data structure that provides a fast way to look up records based on specific columns. It works similar to an index in a book, allowing the database to quickly locate and access rows that match certain criteria. Indexes significantly enhance query performance but may add some overhead during data modification operations.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question15">
            <h2>What is the difference between "INNER JOIN" and "LEFT JOIN"?</h2>
            <p>"INNER JOIN" and "LEFT JOIN" are both types of SQL joins, but they behave differently in terms of the matching and inclusion of rows. An "INNER JOIN" only includes rows with matching values in both tables, effectively filtering out non-matching rows. A "LEFT JOIN," on the other hand, includes all rows from the left (or first) table and the matching rows from the right (or second) table. If no match is found in the right table, the result will contain NULL values.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question16">
            <h2>What is a SQL view and why is it used?</h2>
            <p>A SQL view is a virtual table that is derived from the data stored in one or more underlying tables. It is defined by a query and does not store actual data itself. Views allow you to simplify complex queries, encapsulate business logic, and provide an additional layer of security by restricting direct access to underlying tables. Views also enable data abstraction, making it easier to work with specific subsets of data.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question17">
            <h2>Explain the purpose of the "INSERT INTO" statement in SQL.</h2>
            <p>The "INSERT INTO" statement is used in SQL to add new rows of data to a table. It specifies the table's name and the values to be inserted into each column. If a table has an auto-incrementing primary key, the "INSERT INTO" statement can omit the primary key column, and the database system will automatically generate a unique value for it.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question18">
            <h2>What is the "UPDATE" statement used for in SQL?</h2>
            <p>The "UPDATE" statement is used to modify existing records in a table. It allows you to change the values of specific columns in one or more rows based on specified conditions. The "UPDATE" statement is useful for altering data in response to changes in business requirements or correcting errors in the database.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question19">
            <h2>Explain the concept of database transactions.</h2>
            <p>A database transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL operations that are treated as a single unit of work. Transactions ensure that database operations are executed in a reliable and consistent manner. They adhere to the ACID properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. If any part of a transaction fails, all changes made within that transaction can be rolled back to maintain data integrity.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question20">
            <h2>What is the purpose of the "DELETE" statement in SQL?</h2>
            <p>The "DELETE" statement is used to remove one or more rows from a table based on specified conditions. It allows you to permanently delete data from the database. The "DELETE" statement should be used with caution, as it irreversibly removes data. To retain a record of deleted data, it's common to use "soft deletion" techniques where a flag is set to indicate that a record is deleted but still kept in the database.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question21">
            <h2>Explain the concept of database normalization.</h2>
            <p>Database normalization is the process of organizing and structuring a database to minimize data redundancy and dependency. It involves dividing a database into multiple tables and defining relationships between them. The normalization process follows specific rules or normal forms to eliminate data anomalies and improve data integrity. Higher normal forms result in a more efficient and maintainable database design.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question22">
            <h2>What are stored procedures in MySQL, and why are they useful?</h2>
            <p>Stored procedures are precompiled SQL programs that are stored in the database. They encapsulate a series of SQL statements and can be executed with a single call. Stored procedures enhance database security, reduce network traffic by executing on the server, and promote code reusability. They are particularly useful for complex business logic, data manipulation, and enforcing security rules.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question23">
            <h2>Explain the difference between InnoDB and MyISAM storage engines in MySQL.</h2>
            <p>InnoDB and MyISAM are two popular storage engines in MySQL, each with its characteristics. InnoDB supports transactions, foreign key constraints, and crash recovery, making it suitable for applications that require data integrity. MyISAM is faster for read-heavy workloads but lacks support for transactions and foreign keys. InnoDB is generally recommended for most modern applications due to its features and reliability.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question24">
            <h2>What is the purpose of indexing foreign keys in MySQL?</h2>
            <p>Indexing foreign keys in MySQL improves the efficiency of join operations and maintains referential integrity. When you create an index on a foreign key column, it speeds up the process of looking up related records in the referenced table. This optimization is crucial for query performance when working with tables that have relationships, especially in complex queries involving multiple joins.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question25">
            <h2>Explain the ACID properties in the context of database transactions.</h2>
            <p>The ACID properties are essential characteristics of a reliable database transaction:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Atomicity:</strong> Ensures that a transaction is treated as a single unit of work. Either all changes are committed, or none are.</li>

            <h2>What are triggers in MySQL and how do they work?</h2>
            <p>Triggers are database objects that automatically execute a set of SQL statements when a specific event occurs in the database. These events include INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations on a table. Triggers are useful for enforcing data integrity rules, maintaining audit logs, or performing specific actions in response to changes. They are typically defined in SQL and are executed automatically based on the triggering event.</p>

            <h2>Explain the difference between primary key and unique key constraints.</h2>
            <p>A primary key is a column or set of columns that uniquely identify each record in a table. It ensures data integrity and enforces the uniqueness of values. Only one primary key can exist per table. A unique key constraint, on the other hand, enforces the uniqueness of values in a column or set of columns but does not necessarily define the primary means of identifying records. Multiple unique key constraints can exist in a table.</p>

            <h2>What are prepared statements in MySQL, and how do they enhance security?</h2>
            <p>Prepared statements are SQL templates that allow you to parameterize queries before executing them. This separation of the query and its parameters helps prevent SQL injection attacks by automatically escaping and sanitizing input data. Prepared statements are precompiled and can be reused with different parameter values, improving both performance and security. They are a recommended practice for building secure database applications.</p>

            <h2>Explain the concept of referential integrity in a relational database.</h2>
            <p>Referential integrity is a property of a relational database that ensures the consistency and validity of relationships between tables. It enforces that foreign key values in a child table correspond to primary key values in a parent table. This ensures that data relationships are maintained accurately, and prevents orphaned records or actions that would violate the established relationships.</p>

            <h2>What is a SQL JOIN, and what are its different types?</h2>
            <p>A SQL JOIN is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. The different types of SQL JOINs include:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>INNER JOIN:</strong> Returns only the matched rows from both tables.</li>
                <li><strong>LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN):</strong> Returns all rows from the left table and matched rows from the right table.</li>
                <li><strong>RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN):</strong> Returns all rows from the right table and matched rows from the left table.</li>
                <li><strong>FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN):</strong> Returns all rows when there is a match in either the left or right table.</li>

            <h2>Explain the concept of indexing in a relational database.</h2>
            <p>Indexing in a relational database is the process of creating data structures that allow for efficient data retrieval based on specific columns. Indexes enhance query performance by reducing the need to scan the entire table. They act like a table of contents for the data, allowing the database to quickly locate rows that match the indexed columns. Common types of indexes include primary keys, unique keys, and non-unique indexes.</p>

            <h2>What is a composite key, and when is it used?</h2>
            <p>A composite key is a key that consists of two or more columns in a table. It is used when a single column cannot uniquely identify a row, but the combination of multiple columns does. Composite keys are often used in tables that represent relationships, junction tables, or many-to-many relationships. They ensure that the combination of values is unique, even if individual columns are not.</p>
