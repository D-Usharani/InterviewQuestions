        <div class="question" id="question1">
            <h2>What is React?</h2>
            <p>React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces in web applications. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently update the DOM using its "virtual DOM" technology.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question2">
            <h2>Explain the concept of components in React.</h2>
            <p>Components in React are modular, self-contained units that represent different parts of a user interface. They can be thought of as building blocks that encapsulate logic, UI elements, and behavior. Components can be reused, composed, and nested to create complex UIs.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question3">
            <h2>What is JSX in React?</h2>
            <p>JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension used in React to describe the structure of UI components using XML-like syntax. It allows developers to write HTML-like code alongside JavaScript logic, making it easier to visualize and create React elements.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question4">
            <h2>Explain the difference between functional and class components.</h2>
            <p>Functional components are defined as JavaScript functions and are mainly used to display UI without managing state. Class components are defined as ES6 classes and can manage state, use lifecycle methods, and have more features. However, with the introduction of hooks, functional components can also manage state and use lifecycle-like behavior.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question5">
            <h2>What is the state in React and how is it different from props?</h2>
            <p>The state in React is an internal data storage mechanism used to manage dynamic data within a component. It allows components to maintain and update their own data. Props, on the other hand, are properties passed to a component from its parent component. Unlike state, props are immutable and used for passing data from parent to child components.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question6">
            <h2>What is the significance of "virtual DOM" in React?</h2>
            <p>The virtual DOM is a representation of the actual DOM in memory. React uses it to improve performance by minimizing direct manipulation of the actual DOM. When changes are made to the virtual DOM, React performs a process called "reconciliation" to update only the necessary parts of the actual DOM, reducing rendering and improving efficiency.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question7">
            <h2>Explain the React lifecycle methods.</h2>
            <p>React lifecycle methods are special functions that are called at different stages of a component's life. They include methods like "componentDidMount," "componentDidUpdate," and "componentWillUnmount." These methods allow developers to perform actions such as setting up initial data, updating the UI, and cleaning up resources when a component is unmounted.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question8">
            <h2>What is React Router and how is it used for routing?</h2>
            <p>React Router is a library used for handling client-side routing in React applications. It allows developers to define routes and their associated components, enabling navigation between different views in a single-page application. React Router maintains the application's URL and updates the UI based on route changes without causing a full page reload.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question9">
            <h2>What are React hooks? Give examples of some commonly used hooks.</h2>
            <p>React hooks are functions that allow developers to use state and other React features in functional components. Some commonly used hooks include:
                <br>
                <code>useState</code> for managing state,
                <br>
                <code>useEffect</code> for handling side effects,
                <br>
                <code>useContext</code> for accessing context data,
                <br>
                <code>useRef</code> for accessing DOM elements,
                <br>
                <code>useReducer</code> for more complex state management, and
                <br>
                <code>useCallback</code> and <code>useMemo</code> for performance optimization.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question10">
            <h2>Explain the concept of "props drilling" and how to avoid it.</h2>
            <p>Props drilling occurs when props need to be passed through multiple layers of components to reach a deeply nested child component. It can lead to code that is hard to maintain. To avoid props drilling, you can use techniques like context API, Redux, or restructuring your component hierarchy to pass props directly to the components that need them.</p>

        <div class="question" id="question11">
            <h2>Explain the purpose of the "useState" hook in React.</h2>
            <p>The "useState" hook in React is used to add state management to functional components. It allows components to maintain and update their own local state without needing to use class components. The hook takes an initial state value and returns the current state value and a function to update it. This enables developers to create dynamic and interactive UIs by managing state changes.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question12">
            <h2>What is the "useEffect" hook used for?</h2>
            <p>The "useEffect" hook in React is used to handle side effects in functional components. It allows developers to perform actions such as data fetching, DOM manipulation, and subscribing to external data sources. "useEffect" takes two arguments: a function that represents the side effect and an optional array of dependencies. It runs after the component renders and can also perform cleanup when the component is unmounted.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question13">
            <h2>Explain the concept of "conditional rendering" in React.</h2>
            <p>Conditional rendering in React involves rendering different components or elements based on certain conditions. It allows developers to control which part of the UI is displayed based on the state or props of the component. This can be achieved using conditional statements like "if" or ternary operators. Conditional rendering is useful for creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question14">
            <h2>What is the role of keys in React lists?</h2>
            <p>Keys in React lists are used to help React identify each item in a list when rendering and updating the UI. They provide a way for React to optimize rendering by efficiently updating only the items that have changed. Keys should be unique within the list and remain consistent across renders to ensure proper component reordering and performance.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question15">
            <h2>Explain the importance of React Fragments.</h2>
            <p>React Fragments allow developers to group multiple elements without introducing an additional DOM element. They are useful when you want to return multiple elements from a component without adding an extra wrapping element to the DOM. Fragments help keep the DOM structure clean and organized, while still allowing you to render and update multiple elements as a single unit.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question16">
            <h2>What is the purpose of the "context" API in React?</h2>
            <p>The "context" API in React provides a way to share data between components without needing to pass props explicitly through all levels of the component tree. It allows you to create a global state that can be accessed by any component within the context. This is especially useful for data that is considered "global" to the application, such as user authentication status or theme preferences.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question17">
            <h2>Explain the use of the "useState" hook in React.</h2>
            <p>The "useState" hook in React is used for adding state management to functional components. It allows components to maintain and update their own local state. The hook returns the current state value and a function to update it. This enables developers to create dynamic and interactive UIs by managing state changes and re-rendering the component when the state updates.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question18">
            <h2>What are higher-order components (HOCs) in React?</h2>
            <p>Higher-order components (HOCs) are a design pattern in React where a function takes a component and returns a new enhanced component with additional props or behavior. HOCs allow developers to reuse and share logic between multiple components. They are commonly used for tasks like handling authentication, data fetching, and code reusability.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question19">
            <h2>Explain the concept of Redux in React and its benefits.</h2>
            <p>Redux is a state management library for managing the global state of a React application. It follows a unidirectional data flow architecture and centralizes the application state in a single store. Redux provides predictable and consistent state management, which is especially beneficial for larger and more complex applications. It also enables time-travel debugging, hot-reloading, and easy integration with middleware.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question20">
            <h2>What is React Native and how does it differ from React?</h2>
            <p>React Native is a framework for building mobile applications using JavaScript and React. It allows developers to create native-like user interfaces and functionality for iOS and Android platforms. While React is used for building web applications, React Native targets mobile app development by providing components that map to native UI elements. This allows developers to share code and skills between web and mobile development.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- Add more answers as needed -->

        <div class="question" id="question21">
            <h2>Explain the concept of React Fiber and its significance.</h2>
            <p>React Fiber is a reconciliation algorithm implemented by React to improve the performance and user experience of applications. It allows React to interrupt the rendering process and prioritize high-priority updates, making the user interface more responsive. React Fiber's asynchronous rendering capabilities help prevent UI lock-ups, enhance animation smoothness, and enable better handling of large and complex component trees.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question22">
            <h2>What is the purpose of the "shouldComponentUpdate" lifecycle method?</h2>
            <p>The "shouldComponentUpdate" lifecycle method is used to control whether a component should re-render when its state or props change. By default, React will re-render a component whenever there is a change. However, implementing "shouldComponentUpdate" gives developers more control over the rendering process, allowing them to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders when the component's output does not change.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question23">
            <h2>Explain the role of the "useMemo" hook in optimizing React components.</h2>
            <p>The "useMemo" hook is used to memoize the result of a function or computation. It helps optimize functional components by allowing them to avoid unnecessary recalculations when re-rendering. The hook takes a function and a dependency array as arguments. It ensures that the function is only re-executed when the values in the dependency array change. This is particularly useful for complex calculations or expensive operations that can impact performance.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question24">
            <h2>What are controlled and uncontrolled components in React?</h2>
            <p>In React, controlled components are components whose state is controlled entirely by the application's state management, typically using props and callbacks. Uncontrolled components, on the other hand, store their state in the DOM itself, often using the "ref" attribute. Controlled components provide a more predictable way of managing state and handling user input, while uncontrolled components can be useful for integrating with non-React libraries or handling complex input cases.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question" id="question25">
            <h2>Explain the use of the "useReducer" hook in state management.</h2>
            <p>The "useReducer" hook is an alternative to "useState" for managing more complex state logic in React components. It allows developers to manage state using a reducer function similar to how state is managed in Redux. "useReducer" takes a reducer function and an initial state value as arguments and returns the current state and a dispatch function. This can be especially useful for managing state transitions involving multiple actions and complex logic.</p>

            <h2>What is React's Context API and how is it different from Redux?</h2>
            <p>React's Context API provides a way to pass data through the component tree without needing to pass props explicitly at every level. It is used to create a global state accessible by components within a specific context. While Redux is a state management library that provides a global state container with actions and reducers, React's Context API offers a simpler alternative for sharing state between components without the additional boilerplate and complexity of Redux.</p>

            <h2>Explain the concept of code splitting in React and how it benefits performance.</h2>
            <p>Code splitting is a technique used to optimize the performance of web applications by splitting the application's JavaScript bundle into smaller chunks that are loaded on demand. In React, this is achieved using features like dynamic imports or tools like Webpack's code splitting. Code splitting improves initial page load times and reduces the amount of JavaScript that needs to be downloaded, resulting in faster load times and improved user experience.</p>

            <h2>What are React Portals and why are they used?</h2>
            <p>React Portals allow components to render content outside their parent component's DOM hierarchy. This is useful for scenarios like modal dialogs, popovers, or tooltips where the content needs to be rendered at a different DOM location. Portals provide a way to avoid CSS and stacking context issues that may arise when rendering content within the hierarchy. They enable a cleaner and more flexible approach to rendering UI elements in various parts of the DOM.</p>

            <h2>Explain the purpose of the "memo" function and how it optimizes functional components.</h2>
            <p>The "memo" function in React is a higher-order component that helps optimize functional components by preventing unnecessary re-renders. It works by comparing the previous and current props of the component. If the props haven't changed, "memo" prevents the component from re-rendering, improving performance. This is particularly beneficial for optimizing components that receive props that don't change frequently.</p>

            <h2>What are the benefits of using React Router for handling navigation?</h2>
            <p>React Router is a popular library for handling navigation in React applications. It provides a declarative way to manage different views or pages within a single-page application. Some benefits of using React Router include maintaining a consistent user experience, enabling deep linking, supporting browser history navigation, and allowing developers to define routes and views in a structured and organized manner.</p>
