        <div class="question" id="question1">
            <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
            <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation and formatting of HTML documents. CSS allows web developers to control the layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and other visual aspects of a webpage.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question" id="question2">
            <h2>Explain the three ways to include CSS in an HTML document.</h2>
            <p>The three ways to include CSS in an HTML document are:
            <ul>
                <li>Inline CSS: Applying styles directly to HTML elements using the <code>style</code> attribute.</li>
                <li>Internal CSS: Embedding styles within a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of an HTML document.</li>
                <li>External CSS: Linking to an external CSS file using the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="question" id="question3">
            <h2>What is the purpose of CSS selectors?</h2>
            <p>CSS selectors are used to target and select specific HTML elements in order to apply styles to them. They allow developers to define the elements to which a particular set of CSS rules should be applied. Selectors can be based on element names, classes, IDs, attributes, and more.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question" id="question4">
            <h2>Explain the difference between classes and IDs in CSS.</h2>
            <p>Classes and IDs are both used to target HTML elements for styling, but they have different characteristics:
            <ul>
                <li>Classes: A class is a reusable identifier that can be applied to multiple elements. Elements with the same class can share the same styles.</li>
                <li>IDs: An ID is a unique identifier for a single element. Each element can have only one ID, and IDs are often used for specific and highly unique styling.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="question" id="question5">
            <h2>What is the CSS Box Model?</h2>
            <p>The CSS Box Model is a concept that represents how HTML elements are structured and how they take up space on a webpage. It consists of four layers: content, padding, border, and margin. The total width or height of an element is calculated by summing up the content width/height, padding, border, and margin.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question" id="question6">
            <h2>Explain the difference between margin and padding.</h2>
            <p>Margin and padding are both part of the CSS Box Model, but they serve different purposes:
            <ul>
                <li>Margin: Margins create space around an element and separate it from neighboring elements. Margins are outside the border of an element.</li>
                <li>Padding: Padding creates space within an element's border and separates its content from the border. Padding is inside the border of an element.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="question" id="question7">
            <h2>What is the difference between display: block, display: inline, and display: inline-block?</h2>
            <p>
            <code>display: block</code>: Causes an element to generate a block-level box. It takes up the full width of its parent container and starts on a new line.
        arduino
        Copy code
        <code>display: inline</code>: Causes an element to generate an inline-level box. It only takes up as much width as necessary and does not start on a new line.
        
        <code>display: inline-block</code>: Combines features of both <code>block</code> and <code>inline</code>. It takes up only as much width as necessary, but it can have block-level properties and starts on a new line.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question" id="question8">
            <h2>What is the "float" property in CSS used for?</h2>
            <p>The <code>float</code> property is used to position an element to the left or right of its containing element, allowing content to flow around it. This property is often used for creating multi-column layouts or positioning images within text.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question" id="question9">
            <h2>Explain the purpose of the "position" property in CSS.</h2>
            <p>The <code>position</code> property is used to control the positioning of an element within its containing element. It has several values:
            <ul>
                <li><code>static</code>: The default value; the element follows the normal flow of the document.</li>
                <li><code>relative</code>: The element is positioned relative to its normal position.</li>
                <li><code>absolute</code>: The element is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor, if any.</li>
                <li><code>fixed</code>: The element is positioned relative to the viewport, and it remains fixed even when scrolling.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="question" id="question10">
            <h2>What is the purpose of the "z-index" property?</h2>
            <p>The <code>z-index</code> property is used to control the stacking order of elements that overlap on a webpage. Elements with a higher <code>z-index</code> value will appear above elements with a lower value. This property is particularly useful for creating layered layouts and managing the visual hierarchy of elements.</p>

        <div class="question" id="question11">
            <h2>Explain the concept of CSS specificity.</h2>
            <p>CSS specificity determines which styles are applied to an element when conflicting rules are present. Specificity is calculated based on the number of IDs, classes, and elements in a selector. The more specific a selector is, the higher its specificity value. Inline styles have the highest specificity, followed by IDs, classes, and elements.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question" id="question12">
            <h2>What is the "box-sizing" property used for?</h2>
            <p>The <code>box-sizing</code> property controls how the total width and height of an element are calculated, including padding and border. It has two values:
            <ul>
                <li><code>content-box</code>: The default value; width and height include only the content, excluding padding and border.</li>
                <li><code>border-box</code>: The width and height include the content, padding, and border.</li>
            </ul>

        </div>
        <div class="question" id="question13">
            <h2>Explain the purpose of CSS Flexbox and how it works.</h2>
            <p>CSS Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) is a layout model designed to create advanced and flexible layouts with a predictable behavior. It allows you to distribute space and align items within a container, even when their sizes are unknown or dynamic. Flexbox works by defining a flex container and its child flex items, along with various properties for alignment, ordering, and spacing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question" id="question14">
            <h2>What is CSS Grid Layout and how does it differ from Flexbox?</h2>
            <p>CSS Grid Layout is a layout system that allows you to create two-dimensional grid layouts with rows and columns. It is particularly well-suited for complex layouts where you need precise control over both rows and columns. Unlike Flexbox, which is designed for one-dimensional layouts, Grid Layout excels in creating grid-based structures and aligning items both horizontally and vertically.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question" id="question15">
            <h2>Explain the "transform" property in CSS and give examples of its usage.</h2>
            <p>The <code>transform</code> property allows you to apply various transformations to an element, such as scaling, rotating, skewing, and translating. Some common transformation functions include <code>rotate()</code>, <code>scale()</code>, <code>skew()</code>, and <code>translate()</code>. For example, <code>transform: rotate(45deg);</code> rotates an element by 45 degrees.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question" id="question16">
            <h2>What is the purpose of CSS variables (custom properties)?</h2>
            <p>CSS variables, also known as custom properties, allow you to define reusable values that can be used throughout your CSS stylesheet. They are declared using the <code>--variable-name</code> syntax and can be applied using the <code>var()</code> function. CSS variables make it easier to maintain consistent styles and quickly update multiple instances of a value by modifying the variable declaration.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question" id="question17">
            <h2>Explain the concept of responsive web design and how CSS media queries are used.</h2>
            <p>Responsive web design is an approach to designing and building websites that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. CSS media queries are used to apply different styles based on the characteristics of the user's device, such as screen width, height, orientation, and more. Media queries allow developers to create fluid and adaptable layouts that provide an optimal viewing experience across various devices.</p>

        <div class="question" id="question18">
            <h2>What is the "pseudo-element" in CSS and give examples of its usage.</h2>
            <p>Pseudo-elements are used to style a specific part of an element, such as its content or a specific line. They are denoted by double colons (::) and can be used with certain CSS selectors to target specific parts of an element. For example, <code>p::first-line</code> targets the first line of a paragraph, allowing you to apply unique styles to it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question" id="question19">
            <h2>Explain the concept of CSS animations and transitions.</h2>
            <p>CSS animations and transitions are techniques used to create dynamic and visually appealing effects on a webpage:
            <ul>
                <li>CSS Transitions: Transitions allow you to smoothly change property values over a specified duration, such as fading in an element when hovered.</li>
                <li>CSS Animations: Animations are more complex and allow you to define keyframes and animation sequences to create dynamic motion and effects.</li>
            </ul>

        </div>
        <div class="question" id="question20">
            <h2>What is the "nth-child" selector in CSS and how is it used?</h2>
            <p>The <code>:nth-child()</code> selector is used to target elements based on their position within a parent element. It takes an argument in the form of an expression, such as <code>:nth-child(odd)</code> or <code>:nth-child(3n+1)</code>. This selector is commonly used to apply styles to every nth element in a list or grid layout.</p>

            <h2>Explain the purpose of the "flex" property in CSS Flexbox.</h2>
            <p>The <code>flex</code> property is used to control the sizing and behavior of flex items within a flex container. It is a shorthand property that combines three individual properties: <code>flex-grow</code>, <code>flex-shrink</code>, and <code>flex-basis</code>. The <code>flex-grow</code> value specifies how much an item can grow relative to other items, the <code>flex-shrink</code> value specifies how much an item can shrink, and the <code>flex-basis</code> value sets the initial size of an item.</p>

            <h2>Explain the concept of CSS Grid Layout and how it differs from Flexbox.</h2>
            <p>CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system that allows you to create grid-based layouts with rows and columns. It provides more advanced control over both row and column placement compared to Flexbox. Grid Layout is particularly useful for creating complex layouts with precise control over both dimensions. Unlike Flexbox, which is primarily focused on one-dimensional layouts, Grid Layout handles two-dimensional layouts more effectively.</p>

            <h2>What is the "transform" property in CSS used for?</h2>
            <p>The <code>transform</code> property is used to apply various transformations to an element, such as scaling, rotating, skewing, and translating. Some common transformation functions include <code>rotate()</code>, <code>scale()</code>, <code>skew()</code>, and <code>translate()</code>. For example, <code>transform: rotate(45deg);</code> rotates an element by 45 degrees.</p>

            <h2>Explain the purpose of CSS variables (custom properties) and how they improve maintainability.</h2>
            <p>CSS variables, also known as custom properties, allow you to define reusable values that can be used throughout your CSS stylesheet. They are declared using the <code>--variable-name</code> syntax and can be applied using the <code>var()</code> function. CSS variables make it easier to maintain consistent styles and quickly update multiple instances of a value by modifying the variable declaration. This improves code maintainability and reduces the need for repetitive changes.</p>

            <h2>Explain the concept of responsive web design and how CSS media queries are used.</h2>
            <p>Responsive web design is an approach to designing and building websites that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. CSS media queries are used to apply different styles based on the characteristics of the user's device, such as screen width, height, orientation, and more. Media queries allow developers to create fluid and adaptable layouts that provide an optimal viewing experience across various devices.</p>

            <h2>What is the "pseudo-element" in CSS and give examples of its usage.</h2>
            <p>Pseudo-elements are used to style a specific part of an element, such as its content or a specific line. They are denoted by double colons (::) and can be used with certain CSS selectors to target specific parts of an element. For example, <code>p::first-line</code> targets the first line of a paragraph, allowing you to apply unique styles to it.</p>

            <h2>Explain the concept of CSS animations and transitions.</h2>
            <p>CSS animations and transitions are techniques used to create dynamic and visually appealing effects on a webpage:
            <ul>
                <li>CSS Transitions: Transitions allow you to smoothly change property values over a specified duration, such as fading in an element when hovered.</li>
                <li>CSS Animations: Animations are more complex and allow you to define keyframes and animation sequences to create dynamic motion and effects.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="question" id="question30">
            <h2>What is the "nth-child" selector in CSS and how is it used?</h2>
            <p>The <code>:nth-child()</code> selector is used to target elements based on their position within a parent element. It takes an argument in the form of an expression, such as <code>:nth-child(odd)</code> or <code>:nth-child(3n+1)</code>. This selector is commonly used to apply styles to every nth element in a list or grid layout.</p>
